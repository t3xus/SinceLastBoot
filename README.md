**SinceLastBoot** is a PowerShell-based toolset designed to manage and report system information, configure SSH, and automate cleanup and reporting processes effectively. It combines multiple scripts and resources into a cohesive workflow.

## ðŸš€ **Capabilities**

### **`cleanup.ps1`**
- Deletes specified files (`ds1`, `ds2`, `start.ps1`) without requiring confirmation.
- Ensures efficient cleanup of unnecessary files to maintain system order.
- Registers the `SinceLastBoot` alias to run reports and performs self-deletion.

### **`report.ps1` and `reportexport.ps1`**
- Generates comprehensive system information reports, including details about:
  - CPU, Memory, and Storage usage.
  - System updates and last boot time.
  - Network statistics and recently edited files.
  - Security logs, login attempts, and user information.
- Reports are saved as HTML files for easy review and sharing.

### **`sshd_config.ps1`**
- Configures the `sshd_config` file for OpenSSH on Windows.
- Adds or updates the `ForceCommand` directive to run specific scripts (`report.ps1` and `reportexport.ps1`) upon SSH login.
- Ensures a backup of the original configuration is created for safety.
- Restarts the SSH service to apply changes.

### **`start.ps1`**
- Initializes tasks and serves as an entry point for other scripts in the workflow.
- Ensures critical setup steps are completed before proceeding with further automation.

### **Alias: `SinceLastBoot`**
- Combines the execution of two primary scripts located in:
  - `$env:USERPROFILE\report.ps1`
  - `$env:USERPROFILE\reportexport.ps1`
- Provides a single command alias to streamline the process of running both scripts.
